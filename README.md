My solutions to assignments from [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Course List:

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/pdwarkanath/dl-coursera/tree/master/001%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://github.com/pdwarkanath/dl-coursera/tree/master/002%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks%20Hyperparameter%20tuning%2C%20Regularization%20and%20Optimization)
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/pdwarkanath/dl-coursera/tree/master/004%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)
5. Sequence Models

Currently I have completed assignments till course 2. As I complete assignments in the subsequent courses, I will make folders for them and update them with the completed assignments.
